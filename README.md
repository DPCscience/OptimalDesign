# OptimalDesign
1) For the factorial design, n.c is the number of column and n.r is the number of row. Please make n.c > n.r.
2) Also, if the n.c is a even number, we add an empty vector such that n.c is a odd number. The advantage of odd number is that at least one
candidate are selected for each row and each column. If we don't do that, we can guarantee at least one candidate are from each column but each row.
